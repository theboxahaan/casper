```

### Test Binary Samples 
Test Binary Samples taken from [https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/binary-samples](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/binary-samples)


### Ideas
1. buzi
2. Write your own cstdlib.h 
3. Add [sum types](https://chadaustin.me/2015/07/sum-types/) and pattern matching to the C grammar ?? 
4. Look at the fuscia OS for design - maybe microkernel ?
5. Add a fuzzy search bar like spotlight 
6. Start writing a shell ?
7. Follow build with a series of blogs
8. Switch to C++ ? Will make for smaller code I guess 🤷‍♂️
9. maybe rust? Good to learn something new
